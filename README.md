# Algorithms and Data Structures using Python
Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python

## Workflow

1. [Stanford cs161](https://github.com/Sbk3824/DataStructures_Python/tree/master/Stanford%20cs161): Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. Basic understanding of Data Structures [Class Slides]

2. [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/Sbk3824/DataStructures_Python/tree/master/dsa_GoodRich) by Michael. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia , Michael H. Goldwasser. This book has good introduction to data structures and time complexities.

3. [Educative.io](https://github.com/Sbk3824/DataStructures_Python/tree/master/educative.io): Start with introduction and implementation of data structures and heads towards solving problems using these data structures

4. [epi](https://github.com/Sbk3824/DataStructures_Python/tree/master/epi) : Elements of Programming Interviews book coding challenges. Intermeditate to Hard coding problems solved using Python.

5. [Leetcode](https://github.com/Sbk3824/DataStructures_Python/tree/master/LeetCode): Solution to Leetcode problems.

6. [Python Doc](https://github.com/Sbk3824/DataStructures_Python/tree/master/python%20doc): Implemtation from offcial python documentation.
